Structure for the Autonomous Movement Script
Modules and Classes:

SensorModule: Handles sonar and RGB sensors.
MotionController: Manages motor and chassis movements.
VisionProcessor: Includes image processing for color detection and tracking.
RPCController: Manages remote procedure calls.
MainAutonomousController: Integrates all modules and defines the autonomous behavior.
Implementation Details:

Each class corresponds to a major component from your scripts.
The MainAutonomousController will use the classes to perform autonomous tasks, like 
obstacle avoidance, color tracking, and specific movement patterns.

Key Features in the Script
Sensor Integration:
The SensorModule encapsulates sonar and camera operations, simplifying access to sensor data.
Motion Control:
MotionController allows straightforward motor and chassis movement control.
Vision Processing:
VisionProcessor processes frames for color tracking or other image-based tasks.
Main Controller:
MainAutonomousController integrates all modules, handling the main loop for tasks like 
obstacle avoidance and color tracking.


Current Capabilities
Obstacle Detection and Avoidance:

Uses the sonar sensor to measure distances.
If an obstacle is closer than a set threshold (30 cm), it stops the robot to avoid collisions.
Camera-Based Color Tracking (Simplified):

Captures frames from the camera.
Processes the frame to track a target color (e.g., red) using placeholder logic. The actual color tracking logic from your uploaded files can be integrated here.
Motion Control:

Moves the robot in a straight direction (currently 90°).
Modular design allows you to update it for other directions, velocities, or advanced patterns like turning, drifting, or slanting.
Modularity:

Each functionality (sensors, motion, and vision) is encapsulated in its class.
Easy to extend or replace modules without disrupting the whole system.
Fail-Safe Handling:

Includes a stop mechanism that halts all motors and sensors when a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C) occurs.

Current Workflow
Initialization:
The robot initializes its sensors (sonar and camera) and motion controller (mecanum wheels).
Main Loop:
Periodically checks the sonar sensor for obstacles.
Continuously processes camera frames for color tracking.
Moves the robot forward at a constant speed and direction (90°).
Stopping:
When the script stops, all motors are halted, and the camera is closed.


Limitations
Color Tracking Logic:

The VisionProcessor only contains placeholder logic. The actual color detection, as implemented in your provided scripts (ColorTracking.py), is not yet fully integrated.
Complex Movements:

The motion is basic and limited to forward movement at a fixed velocity and direction.
Advanced patterns (e.g., drifting, turning, slanting) from scripts like Car_Slant_Demo.py and Car_Drifting_Demo.py are not yet included.
No RPC Integration:

The RPC server functionalities (RPCServer.py) are not connected to enable remote control or dynamic behavior changes.
Thresholds and Parameters:

Distance threshold (30 cm) and other parameters are hardcoded. There's no dynamic configuration mechanism.
Voltage Monitoring:

Although present in your files (MasterPi.py), voltage detection is not yet integrated to monitor battery levels.




Next Steps to Enhance the Script
Integrate Advanced Vision Processing:

Use functions from ColorTracking.py to implement detailed color detection and tracking.
Add functionality for color sorting, patrol, and visual tracking.
Implement Dynamic Movement:

Integrate movement patterns from scripts like Car_Move_Demo.py, Car_Slant_Demo.py, and Car_Turn_Demo.py.
Add RPC Capabilities:

Use RPCServer.py to enable remote control of the robot for testing or dynamic updates to its behavior.
Incorporate Voltage Monitoring:

Add battery monitoring and warnings using MasterPi.py.
Customize PID Control:

Integrate advanced PID logic from PID.py to enhance smooth motion and precise tracking.
